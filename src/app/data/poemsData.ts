Intense. You make me feel ok being just a boy.

Intense. The thought of life without you hurts every part of me.

Intense. I care about you too much to put in words.

Intense. Your smile strengthens my heart.

Intense. Your tears break my walls.

Intense. I miss you every second I am not with you.

Intense. I pray I never go without you.

Intense. You have seen my worst.

Intense. You stick by me regardless.

Intense. I hope to be like you one day.

Intense. So that I can love you the way you love me.

Intense. Thank you Artemis.

Intense. I didn’t know love could be this… Intense.`,

That is how long it has been since I knew I couldn’t live without you.

1.25 years. 15 months. 459 days. 11016 hours. 660'960 minutes. 39'657'600 seconds.

I have had a smile on my face, knowing you are beside me.

1.25 years. 15 months. 459 days. 11016 hours. 660'960 minutes. 39'657'600 seconds.

Sometimes it’s really hard to resist crying when I see old videos of us.

1.25 years. 15 months. 459 days. 11016 hours. 660'960 minutes. 39'657'600 seconds.

Because I know how thankful I am to have you, my princess.

1.25 years. 15 months. 459 days. 11016 hours. 660'960 minutes. 39'657'600 seconds.

My eyes are watering up at the thought of losing you.

1.25 years. 15 months. 459 days. 11016 hours. 660'960 minutes. 39'657'600 seconds.

I can’t bear a life without you.

1.25 years. 15 months. 459 days. 11016 hours. 660'960 minutes. 39'657'600 seconds.

Thank you for everything Artemis.

1.25 years. 15 months. 459 days. 11016 hours. 660'960 minutes. 39'657'600 seconds.

I want to live the next 100 years with no body but you by my side. 

100 years. 1200 months. 36'500 days. 876'000 hours. 52'560'000 minutes. 3'153'600'000 seconds.

I love the crap out of you, and that is the shit

For real girlie, I will kill just for your clit

You will forever be the only girl for me, don’t you trip

My only question is, why did I get picked?

You are a 12/10, and that ain’t flipped

If anyone ever touched you, they would be clipped

I love you to the moon and back, and that is a fix`,
